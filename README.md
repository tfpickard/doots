## Introduction

Ah, the introduction. The part where we tell you how this project will change your life. Spoiler alert: it probably won't. But it will make your terminal look pretty, and isn't that what really matters?

## Installation

To install this project, you'll need to follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository. This is the easy part.
2. Run the `Makefile`. This is where things get interesting.
3. Pray to the tech gods that everything works as expected.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepository.git
cd yourrepository
make
```

## Usage

Once installed, you can use this project to do... things. Important things. Things that will make you the envy of all your friends who also use the command line.

## Configuration

This project is highly configurable. In fact, it's so configurable that you might spend more time configuring it than actually using it. But that's part of the fun, right?

## Neovim Configuration

The Neovim setup is a delightful concoction of plugins and custom settings designed to make your coding experience as smooth as a freshly buttered slide. Here's a breakdown of the key components:

- **Plugin Management**: Managed by `lazy.nvim`, ensuring that all plugins are loaded efficiently. The configuration is modular, with each plugin having its own setup file in `.config/nvim/lua/plugins/`.

- **Syntax Highlighting**: Powered by `nvim-treesitter`, which provides advanced syntax highlighting and code understanding. This is configured in `treesitter.lua` to ensure all necessary languages are supported.

- **Autocompletion**: Handled by `nvim-cmp`, with sources configured for LSP, buffer, and path completions. The setup in `completion.lua` ensures a seamless typing experience with intelligent suggestions.

- **Status Line**: `lualine.nvim` is used for a customizable and informative status line. The configuration in `lualine.lua` includes sections for mode, diagnostics, and more, all styled with the `fluoromachine` theme.

- **File Explorer**: `nvim-tree.lua` provides a sidebar file explorer, configured to integrate smoothly with the rest of the setup.

- **LSP Configuration**: Managed by `mason.nvim` and `mason-lspconfig.nvim`, which automate the installation and configuration of language servers. The `lspconfig.lua` file includes custom keybindings for LSP actions.

- **Additional Features**: Includes `which-key.nvim` for keybinding hints, `telescope.nvim` for fuzzy finding, and `gitsigns.nvim` for Git integration.

The configuration files are located in `.config/nvim/lua/plugins/` and are organized by functionality, such as `completion.lua` for autocompletion settings and `lualine.lua` for status line customization. Each file is meticulously crafted to ensure a cohesive and efficient development environment.

## Hyprland Configuration

Hyprland is configured to provide a visually appealing and efficient window management experience. The configuration files are located in `.config/hypr/conf/` and include settings for window decorations, animations, and keybindings. The `autostart.conf` file ensures that essential services and applications are launched at startup, while `keybindings/default.conf` defines the keyboard shortcuts for window management and application launching.

## Zsh Configuration

The Zsh setup is powered by `oh-my-zsh` and `powerlevel10k`, providing a visually stunning and highly functional command line interface. The configuration is defined in `.zshrc`, which includes plugin management via `znap` and custom keybindings for efficient navigation. The `p10k.zsh` file contains the theme settings for `powerlevel10k`, allowing you to customize the appearance of your prompt to your heart's content.

## Tmux Configuration

Tmux is configured to enhance your terminal multiplexing experience with a vibrant color scheme and intuitive keybindings. The configuration file `.tmux.conf` includes settings for window and pane management, as well as plugins for additional functionality. The `tpm` (Tmux Plugin Manager) is used to manage plugins, ensuring that your Tmux setup is both powerful and easy to maintain.
